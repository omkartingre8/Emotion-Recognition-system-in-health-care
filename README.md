Emotion-Recognition system in health care using IOT and Machine Learning

There is a growing interest and need for the detection of the emotion of a par- ticular individual in various circumstances and locations such as Airport, Hotel Lobbies, Railway Stations, prison cells, etc. This is might be because of there is always a chance that someone with unhealthy motives would create some mishap. It is also useful in situations such as interrogations and lie detector tests to iden- tify the emotion of the person being monitored. The recognition of the motion is highly difficult and requires the use of expertise and a human being utilized for the purpose of identifying the emotion is not always accurate and can be bi- ased towards the individual. Most of the approaches that have been implementing various sensors and facial recognition have a lot of limitations along with lacklus- ter performance that has left a lot to be desired from the conventional emotion recognition applications. Thus, the proposed system addresses these concerns by taking a step towards outlining a system that can automatically identify human emotions with the help of various parameters such as ECG signals, body tem- perature, and heart rate by using Dataset and Real-time Hardware Sensors. The proposed methodology implements K-means clustering, artificial neural networks, and Fuzzy classification to achieve highly accurate emotion classification.
